# Compiler-with-Symbol-Table-Type-Checking-and-Scope-Resolution

## Project: Compiler with Symbol Table and Type Checking

In this project, I designed and implemented a compiler with a symbol table and type checking functionality, showcasing my understanding of compiler concepts and programming language semantics. This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ and my ability to tackle complex programming tasks.

## Key Contributions:
Developed a context-free grammar: Designed a context-free grammar to accept common programming language statements. Implemented parsing techniques to handle different language constructs, ensuring accurate syntax analysis.
Symbol table management: Incorporated a symbol table that efficiently tracks variables and function arguments. Implemented the symbol table as an array/hash table, populating it during declaration statements. Ensured efficient lookup operations to retrieve variable names and types.

## Type checking: 
Added robust type-checking code for assignment statements. Derived the type of expressions, ensuring compatibility between boolean and integer-point variables/constants. Raised warnings for assigning incompatible types and checked for undeclared variables, flagging errors when necessary.
Proficiency in C++: Utilized C++ to implement the compiler project. Leveraged advanced language features and techniques, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. Employed modular design to enhance code organization and maintainability.

## Additional Contributions:
Optimization techniques: Implemented additional optimizations to enhance the efficiency of the compiler, such as constant folding, dead code elimination, or code generation optimizations. Achieved improved performance and generated optimized code.
Error reporting and recovery: Implemented comprehensive error reporting mechanisms, providing meaningful error messages to aid in debugging. Developed error recovery strategies to handle syntactic or semantic errors gracefully, ensuring the compiler continues processing subsequent statements.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
## Programming Languages: C++
## Development Tools: Compiler construction tools (lex/yacc, ANTLR, etc.), IDEs (Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)


## Outcome:
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of compiler design and implementation. By incorporating a symbol table and type checking, I developed a compiler that not only parsed and analyzed programming language statements but also enforced proper variable usage and assignment compatibility. This project showcased my ability to handle complex programming tasks, apply language semantics, and demonstrate attention to detail.
